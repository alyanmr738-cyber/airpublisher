# Fix: New Users Seeing Wrong Creator Profile

## 🔴 Problem

When a new user signs up, they're seeing "Alyan Raheel" (the first user's profile) instead of their own profile or being prompted to create one.

## 🐛 Root Cause

The `getCurrentCreator()` function in `lib/db/creator.ts` had a **dangerous fallback** that returned the **most recent profile** from the database when it couldn't find a user-specific profile. This meant:

1. New user signs up
2. `getCurrentCreator()` can't find their profile (because they haven't created one yet)
3. Fallback kicks in and returns the most recent profile (Alyan Raheel's)
4. New user sees the wrong profile

## ✅ Fix Applied

1. **Removed the "most recent profile" fallback** from `getCurrentCreator()`
2. **Improved `getCreatorByUserId()`** to better match profiles by user ID
3. **Added better logging** to track profile lookups

## 🔍 How It Works Now

1. **User signs up** → Creates account in Supabase Auth
2. **User redirected to dashboard** → `getCurrentCreator()` is called
3. **Profile lookup**:
   - First: Check cookie for stored profile ID
   - Second: Try to find profile by user ID pattern in `unique_identifier`
   - Third: If no profile found, return `null` (user needs to create profile)
4. **If no profile** → User is redirected to `/setup` to create their profile
5. **After profile creation** → Profile ID stored in cookie and linked to user

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Sign up with a new email** (e.g., `test@example.com`)
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - If no profile exists, should redirect to `/setup`
   - Should NOT show "Alyan Raheel" profile
3. **Create profile** → Should see your own profile
4. **Sign out and sign in again** → Should still see your own profile

## 📝 Profile Creation Flow

When a user creates a profile:
- `unique_identifier` is generated as: `creator_${userId.slice(0, 8)}_${timestamp}_${random}`
- This ensures each user has a unique identifier that can be matched back to their user ID
- Profile ID is stored in a cookie for quick lookups

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No more fallbacks**: The code will NOT return a random profile if user's profile isn't found
- **User must create profile**: New users will be prompted to create a profile at `/setup`
- **Cookie-based lookup**: Once created, profile is stored in cookie for faster lookups

**If you still see the wrong profile:**
1. Clear your browser cookies
2. Sign out and sign in again
3. Check browser console for profile lookup logs
4. Verify your profile exists in Supabase: `creator_profiles` table
