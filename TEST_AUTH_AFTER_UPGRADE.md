# Test Auth After @supabase/ssr Upgrade

## What Changed
✅ Upgraded `@supabase/ssr` from `0.1.0` to latest version (should be `0.5.0+`)
✅ This should fix the cookie parsing issue

## Steps to Test

1. **Restart dev server** (if running):
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Login**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Sign in with your credentials
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`

3. **Check Auth Status**:
   - Visit `/api/debug/auth-check` after logging in
   - Check if `regularClient.canGetUser` is now `true`
   - Check if `regularClient.canGetSession` is now `true`
   - Check if `regularClient.userId` shows your user ID

4. **Check Profile Persistence**:
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Refresh the page
   - Profile should still be there (no "create profile" prompt)

## Expected Results

After upgrade:
- ✅ `getUser()` should work (no more "Auth session missing!")
- ✅ `getSession()` should return session object
- ✅ Server-side auth checks should pass
- ✅ Profile should persist across page loads

## If Still Not Working

If auth still doesn't work:
1. Clear browser cookies for localhost:3000
2. Restart dev server
3. Try logging in again
4. Check `/api/debug/auth-check` again
