You signed up but didn't receive the verification email.

## ✅ Solution: Enable Email Verification in Supabase

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard

1. **Open**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pezvnqhexxttlhcnbtta/auth/providers
2. **Or**: Go to your project → Authentication → Providers

### Step 2: Enable Email Provider

3. **Click**: "Configure" or settings icon

### Step 3: Configure Email Settings

2. **Check**: "Enable email confirmations" is **ON**
3. **Set**: "Confirm email" to **ON**

### Step 4: Check Email Templates

3. **Verify**: Template is enabled and has correct redirect URL

### Step 5: Set Redirect URL

In the email template, make sure the redirect URL is:

https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
```

## 🔍 Check if Email Was Sent

### Option 1: Check Supabase Logs

1. **Go to**: Supabase Dashboard → Logs → Auth Logs
2. **Look for**: Email send events
3. **Check**: If email was sent or if there was an error

### Option 2: Check Spam Folder

- Check your spam/junk folder
- Check promotions tab (Gmail)
- Check all mail folders

### Option 3: Check Supabase Email Settings

1. **Go to**: Settings → Auth
2. **Check**: "Site URL" is set correctly
3. **Check**: "Redirect URLs" includes your callback URL

## 🧪 Test Email Verification

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Development)

For development/testing, you can temporarily disable email confirmation:

1. **Go to**: Authentication → Settings
2. **Set**: "Enable email confirmations" to **OFF**
3. **Save**

**Note**: This allows immediate sign-in without email verification (for testing only).

### Option 2: Use Supabase Magic Link

Instead of password signup, you can use magic link (email-only signup):

1. User enters email
2. Receives magic link
3. Clicks link → Automatically signed in

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Email Verification

If emails aren't working, you can manually verify users:

1. **Go to**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. **Find**: Your user account
3. **Click**: User email
4. **Click**: "Confirm email" button (or similar)
5. **User can now sign in**
