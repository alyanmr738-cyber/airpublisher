## Step-by-Step: What You're Seeing

**What to select:**
- ✅ **"Connect Business Portfolio"** ← **SELECT THIS ONE**
- OR **"Manage Business Account"**
- OR **"Build Connected Experiences"**

**Why:** These are the only use cases that support Instagram Graph API for posting.

**What to do:**
1. **If you have Business Manager:**
   - Click **"Connect"** and select your Business Manager
   - OR click **"Skip"** if you want to add it later

2. **If you DON'T have Business Manager:**
   - Click **"Skip"** or **"Not Now"** ← **DO THIS**
   - You don't need it for development/testing
   - You can add it later if needed

**Important:** You can skip this step! It's optional for development.

### Step 3: Verify Business and App
**What you see:** "Verify Business and App" or "Business Verification"

**What to do:**
- Click **"Skip"** or **"Not Now"** ← **DO THIS**

## After App Creation

Once your app is created:

1. **Add Instagram Graph API:**
   - Go to **Products** (left sidebar)
   - Find **"Instagram Graph API"**
   - Click **"Set Up"**

2. **Set OAuth Redirect URI:**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Basic**
   - Scroll to **"Add Platform"** → Add **"Website"**
   - Site URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Go to **Products** → **Instagram Graph API** → **Basic Display**
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/instagram/callback`

3. **Get Credentials:**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Basic**
   - Copy **App ID** and **App Secret**
   - Add to `.env.local`

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't skip verification"**
- Try clicking "Not Now" or "Skip for Now"
- Some accounts may require it - in that case, you'll need to provide basic business info

**"Business Portfolio required"**
- This is usually optional
- If it's blocking you, you can create a free Business Manager account at business.facebook.com
- Then link it, or try a different use case

**"App type not suitable"**
- Make sure you selected "Connect Business Portfolio" or "Manage Business Account"
- These are the only use cases that support Instagram posting
