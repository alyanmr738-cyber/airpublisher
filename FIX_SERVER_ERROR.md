# Fix Internal Server Error

## Problem
The server error is caused by:
1. **Google Fonts fetch failing** - Network can't reach fonts.googleapis.com
2. **Permission errors** - Some file access issues

## Solution Applied

I've updated the font configuration to:
- Use better fallback fonts
- Disable font fallback adjustment to prevent errors
- Use system fonts if Google Fonts fails

## To Fix:

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl + C)
2. Clear cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```
3. Restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: If Still Getting Errors
The font will now fallback to system fonts if Google Fonts can't load, so the app should work even without internet.

### Option 3: Check Network
If you're behind a firewall or VPN, make sure it allows access to:
- `fonts.googleapis.com`
- `fonts.gstatic.com`

## What Changed:
- Font loading is now more resilient
- System fonts will be used if Google Fonts fails
- App should work even without internet connection

Try restarting the dev server now - it should work!
