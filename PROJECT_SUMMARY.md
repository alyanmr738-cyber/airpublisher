## Key Design Decisions

1. **Creator Identity**: Uses `unique_identifier` from `creator_profiles` as the join key across all AIR products
2. **Scoring Formula**: Configurable in `lib/db/leaderboard.ts` - currently: `(views * 0.4) + (likes * 0.2) + (comments * 0.2) + (revenue * 2)`
3. **Status Flow**: `draft` → `scheduled` → `posted` (or `failed`)
4. **Platform Support**: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Internal (AIR platform)
5. **Leaderboard Periods**: Daily, Weekly, and All-Time with niche filtering

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure Supabase project
   - Set up storage bucket
   - Add environment variables
   - Run database migrations

2. **Platform APIs**
   - Obtain API credentials for each platform
   - Implement OAuth flows
   - Build posting logic
   - Set up webhooks

3. **Storage Implementation**
   - Configure Supabase Storage bucket
   - Implement file upload flow
   - Add video processing
   - Set up CDN if needed

4. **Metrics Collection**
   - Build platform API integrations
   - Set up polling or webhooks
   - Aggregate performance data
   - Update leaderboards

5. **Automation**
   - Set up cron jobs (Vercel Cron or similar)
   - Implement scheduled post execution
   - Build notification system

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for utilities
   - Integration tests for API routes
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - Load testing for leaderboards

## Notes

- The codebase is production-ready in structure but requires platform API integrations for full functionality
- All placeholder logic is clearly marked with TODO comments
- The design follows creator-first principles with a premium, high-leverage feel
- The system is designed to integrate cleanly with other AIR products (Clone, Ideas, Courses)
