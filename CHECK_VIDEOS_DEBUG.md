# Debug: Why "My Videos" is Empty

## 🔍 Step 1: Check Debug Endpoint

Visit this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/debug/my-videos
```

This will show:
- Your creator profile (unique_identifier)
- Videos found via function
- Videos found via direct query  
- ALL videos in database
- Any errors or mismatches

**Share the output** so I can see what's happening.

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Terminal Logs

When you visit `/videos` page, check your **terminal** (where `npm run dev` runs) for:

```
[getVideosByCreator] Fetching videos for creator: ...
[getVideosByCreator] ✅ Found videos: X
```

If it shows `Found videos: 0`, check:
- What `creator_unique_identifier` it's searching for
- What `creator_unique_identifier` your videos have

## 🔍 Step 3: Check Supabase Directly

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
2. Open `air_publisher_videos` table
3. Check:
   - Do any videos exist?
   - What's the `creator_unique_identifier` on the videos?
   - What's the `status`?

4. Open `creator_profiles` table  
5. Check:
   - What's your `unique_identifier`?
   - Does it match the `creator_unique_identifier` in videos?

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Creator Unique Identifier Mismatch

**Symptoms**: Videos exist but have different `creator_unique_identifier`

**Fix**: The video creation should use `creator.unique_identifier` from `getCurrentCreator()`

**Check**: Debug endpoint will show this

---

### Issue 2: Video Not Created in Database

**Symptoms**: No videos in Supabase at all

**Check**: 
- Terminal logs when uploading - does it say "Video created successfully"?
- Supabase Dashboard - is there a video record?

**Fix**: If creation is failing, check `[createVideoAction]` logs in terminal

---

### Issue 3: RLS Blocking Query

**Symptoms**: Videos exist in Supabase but query returns empty

**Check**: Debug endpoint shows "RLS blocked" or direct query works but function doesn't

**Fix**: Already added service role fallback in logging (will help diagnose)

---

## ✅ Quick Test

1. **Upload a video** (if you haven't)
2. **Check terminal** - does it say "Video created successfully"?
3. **Check Supabase** - does video exist in `air_publisher_videos` table?
4. **Visit** `/api/debug/my-videos` - what does it show?
5. **Visit** `/videos` - does it show videos now?
