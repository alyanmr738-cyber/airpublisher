# Fix: Video Not Being Created in Database

## 🔍 Problem

Debug shows: `allVideosCount: 0` - **NO videos exist in database**

This means `createVideoAction` is **failing silently**.

---

## ⚠️ Most Likely Issue: Missing `views` Column

I added `views: 0` to video creation, but if the column doesn't exist yet, the insert will fail!

**Fix: Run this migration in Supabase:**

```sql
-- Add views column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE air_publisher_videos
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS views INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

## 🧪 Check Terminal Logs

When you upload, check terminal for:

**Success should show:**
```
[createVideoAction] Starting video creation...
[createVideoAction] Creator found: dev_1768500291985_chydy8y
[createVideoAction] Video data to insert: {...}
[createVideoAction] ✅ Video created successfully: {id}
```

**Error would show:**
```
[createVideoAction] Regular client error: ...
[createVideoAction] Service client error: ...
```

**Share the terminal logs** when you upload - they'll show the exact error!

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps

1. **Run migration** (if `views` column missing):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE air_publisher_videos
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS views INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
   ```

2. **Try uploading again**

3. **Watch terminal** for `[createVideoAction]` logs

4. **Check Supabase** - does video appear in `air_publisher_videos` table?

**If `views` column doesn't exist, that's why videos aren't being created!** 🎯
