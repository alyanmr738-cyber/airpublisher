# Fix Build Cache Error

## Problem
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/suniya/Desktop/airpublisher/.next/server/app/(auth)/login/page.js'
```

This error means Next.js is looking for a compiled file that doesn't exist. The build cache is corrupted.

## Solution

I've cleared the `.next` cache. Now:

1. **Stop the dev server** (if running):
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal

2. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for the build to complete**:
   - You should see "Ready" in the terminal
   - The first build might take a minute

4. **Refresh your browser**

## Why This Happens

- Build cache gets corrupted
- Files were deleted while server was running
- Incomplete build process

## Prevention

- Always stop the dev server before deleting files
- Clear `.next` cache if you see strange errors
- Restart dev server after major changes

The app should now work correctly!
