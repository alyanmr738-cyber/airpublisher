# Third-Party Social Media API Options

Instead of implementing OAuth flows ourselves, we can use a service that already handles everything.

## Recommended Options

### 1. **Buffer API** ⭐ (Recommended)
- **What it does:** Social media management platform with comprehensive API
- **Platforms:** YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok
- **Pros:**
  - Clean, well-documented API
  - Handles all OAuth flows
  - Good free tier for testing
  - Reliable and established
- **Cons:**
  - Paid plans for production use
  - Some limitations on free tier
- **Pricing:** Free tier available, paid plans start at ~$6/month
- **API Docs:** https://buffer.com/developers/api

### 2. **Later API**

- **Platforms:** Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok
- **Pros:**
  - Great for Instagram
  - Simple API
  - Good free tier
- **Cons:**
  - Limited platform support (no YouTube)
  - Less comprehensive than Buffer

## Recommended: Buffer API

**Why Buffer?**
1. ✅ Supports all platforms we need (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
2. ✅ Clean, well-documented API
3. ✅ Handles all OAuth complexity
4. ✅ Good free tier for development
5. ✅ Reliable and widely used
6. ✅ Good developer support

---

## How It Would Work

### Current Flow (What We Built):
```
User → Our OAuth → YouTube/Instagram/TikTok → Store tokens → Post via their APIs
```

### With Buffer API:
```
User → Buffer OAuth → Buffer handles YouTube/Instagram/TikTok → We use Buffer API to post
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ No need to manage OAuth flows ourselves
- ✅ No need to store tokens (Buffer handles it)
- ✅ No need to refresh tokens (Buffer handles it)
- ✅ Simpler codebase
- ✅ Less maintenance
- ✅ Buffer handles all platform API changes

### What We'd Need to Do:
1. Sign up for Buffer account
2. Create a Buffer app
3. Get API credentials
4. Integrate Buffer OAuth flow (much simpler)
5. Use Buffer API to post content

---

## Implementation with Buffer

### Step 1: Buffer Setup
1. Go to https://buffer.com/developers
2. Create a new app
3. Get Client ID and Client Secret
4. Set redirect URI: `https://airpublisher.onrender.com/api/auth/buffer/callback`

### Step 2: OAuth Flow (Simplified)
```typescript
// Initiate Buffer OAuth
const bufferAuthUrl = `https://buffer.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${BUFFER_CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&response_type=code`

// User authorizes → Buffer redirects back with code
// Exchange code for access token via Buffer API
// Store Buffer access token (not platform tokens)
```

### Step 3: Post Content
```typescript
// Post to YouTube via Buffer
POST https://api.bufferapp.com/1/updates/create.json
{
  "text": "Video title",
  "media": {
    "photo": "video_url",
    "thumbnail": "thumbnail_url"
  },
  "profile_ids": ["youtube_profile_id"]
}
```

## Code Changes Needed

### Remove:
- ❌ All OAuth callback routes for YouTube/Instagram/TikTok
- ❌ Token storage logic for individual platforms
- ❌ Platform-specific API calls

### Add:
- ✅ Buffer OAuth flow (much simpler)
- ✅ Buffer API integration
- ✅ Single token storage (Buffer token only)

### Files to Modify:
- Replace `app/api/auth/youtube/` → `app/api/auth/buffer/`
- Replace `app/api/auth/instagram/` → Remove (handled by Buffer)
- Replace `app/api/auth/tiktok/` → Remove (handled by Buffer)
- Update `app/(dashboard)/settings/connections/page.tsx` to show Buffer connection
- Create `lib/buffer/api.ts` for Buffer API calls

---

## Cost Comparison

### Current Approach (DIY):
- **Cost:** Free (just OAuth apps)
- **Time:** High (maintaining OAuth flows, token refresh, API changes)
- **Complexity:** High

### Buffer API:
- **Cost:** ~$6-15/month (depending on usage)
- **Time:** Low (they handle everything)
- **Complexity:** Low

---

## Recommendation

**Use Buffer API** - It will significantly simplify your codebase and reduce maintenance burden.

Would you like me to:
1. Implement Buffer API integration?
2. Remove the current OAuth code?
3. Update the connections page to use Buffer?

Let me know and I'll refactor the code!
