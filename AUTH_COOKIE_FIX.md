# Auth Cookie Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
✅ **Cookie exists**: `sb-pezvnqhexxttlhcnbtta-auth-token` with valid JSON (2238 chars)
❌ **getSession() returns null**: Even though cookie exists
❌ **getUser() fails**: "Auth session missing!" error

## Root Cause
The cookie contains valid session data, but `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` isn't parsing it correctly. This is a known issue with older versions of `@supabase/ssr` or cookie parsing.

## Current Status
- ✅ Cookie format is correct (valid JSON with access_token, refresh_token, user)
- ✅ Middleware is running and attempting to refresh session
- ❌ Server-side `getUser()`/`getSession()` can't read the cookie

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Test the updated middleware** - Try logging in again and check if `getSession()` works now
2. **Upgrade @supabase/ssr** - Currently using `^0.1.0`, latest is `^0.5.0+`
3. **Check cookie attributes** - Ensure path, domain, SameSite are correct

## Workaround (For Now)
Since we can't read the session server-side, we're:
- Using client-provided `user_id` for profile creation
- Using service role client for operations that need auth
- Using cookie-based profile lookup (not session-based)
