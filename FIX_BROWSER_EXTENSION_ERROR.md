# Fix Browser Extension Error

## Problem
The error `Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser` is coming from a **browser extension**, not your code.

The file `org-chart-overlay-injected.js` is injected by a browser extension (likely a LinkedIn org chart or similar tool).

## Solution

### Option 1: Disable the Extension (Recommended)
1. Open Chrome/Edge extensions: `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
2. Find the extension that adds org chart overlays (might be LinkedIn-related)
3. Disable it temporarily
4. Refresh your app

### Option 2: Ignore the Error
This error doesn't affect your app's functionality. It's just the extension trying to inject code. You can:
- Ignore it (it won't break your app)
- Use DevTools to filter out extension errors

### Option 3: Use Incognito Mode
Test your app in incognito/private mode where extensions are usually disabled.

## How to Filter Extension Errors in DevTools

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. Click the filter icon (funnel)
4. Add filter: `-org-chart` or `-injected`
5. This will hide extension-related errors

## Note
This is **NOT** an error in your code. Your app is working fine - it's just a browser extension causing noise in the console.
