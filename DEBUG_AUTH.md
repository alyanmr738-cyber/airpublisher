# Debug Authentication Issue

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Added development mode bypass to settings page (like dashboard layout)
2. ✅ Added better error logging
3. ✅ Handle null user gracefully

## Check Terminal Logs

When you try to access `/settings/connections`, check your terminal for:

```
[ConnectionsPage] Auth check: { hasUser: true/false, userEmail: '...', error: ... }
```

## If Still Redirecting

### Option 1: Check Session

1. Open browser DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Look for Supabase auth cookies:
   - `sb-<project-id>-auth-token`
   - `sb-<project-id>-auth-token-code-verifier`
3. If missing, you're not logged in

### Option 2: Force Login

1. Go to `/login`
2. Sign in with `alyanmr738@gmail.com`
3. Check if you're redirected to dashboard
4. Then try `/settings/connections`

### Option 3: Check Environment

Make sure you're in development mode:
- `NODE_ENV=development` in `.env.local`
- Or the app should detect it automatically

### Option 4: Temporary Bypass

If you want to test without auth, the dashboard layout already has a bypass. The settings page now has it too.

## What to Check

1. **Terminal logs** - What does `[ConnectionsPage] Auth check:` show?
2. **Browser console** - Any errors?
3. **Network tab** - Is the request to `/settings/connections` being made?
4. **Cookies** - Are Supabase auth cookies present?

Let me know what the terminal logs show!
