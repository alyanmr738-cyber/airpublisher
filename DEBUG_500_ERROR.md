# Debug 500 Error

## What I've Fixed

1. **Middleware** - Now skips root path (`/`) to prevent errors
2. **Server Client** - Added error handling for missing env vars
3. **Better error handling** - All Supabase calls now have try-catch

## To See the Actual Error

**Please check your terminal** where `npm run dev` is running and share:
1. The exact error message
2. The stack trace
3. Which file/line it's failing on

## Quick Test

Try accessing these URLs to see which works:
- `http://localhost:3000/` (home page)
- `http://localhost:3000/login` (login page)
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (dashboard)

## Common Causes

1. **Missing environment variables** - Check `.env.local` exists
2. **Supabase connection issue** - Check if Supabase URL/key are correct
3. **Build cache issue** - Already cleared, but try again if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop (Ctrl + C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check terminal output** - Look for red error messages

3. **Share the error** - Copy the error from terminal and share it

The middleware now skips the root path, so the home page should work. If it still doesn't, the error is likely in the Providers component or layout.
