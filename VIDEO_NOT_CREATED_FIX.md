# Fix: Video Not Being Created in Database

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The debug endpoint shows:
- ✅ Creator exists: `dev_1768500291985_chydy8y`
- ❌ **NO videos in database**: `allVideosCount: 0`

This means `createVideoAction` is **failing silently** or **not being called**.

---

## 🐛 Possible Causes

### 1. Video Creation Failing (Silently)

**Check terminal logs** when you upload - look for:
```
[createVideoAction] Starting video creation...
[createVideoAction] Creator found: dev_1768500291985_chydy8y
[createVideoAction] Video data to insert: {...}
[createVideoAction] ✅ Video created successfully: {id}
```

If you DON'T see "✅ Video created successfully", the creation is failing.

### 2. Error Being Swallowed

**Check browser console** (F12) when uploading:
- Look for errors after clicking "Upload Video"
- Check if `createVideoAction` throws an error

---

### 3. Table Doesn't Exist

**Check Supabase Dashboard**:
- Table Editor → Does `air_publisher_videos` table exist?
- If not, run migration: `supabase/migrations/001_create_air_publisher_tables.sql`

---

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

1. **Better error handling** in upload form
2. **Redirect to /videos** after successful upload
3. **More logging** in createVideoAction

---

## 🧪 Test Steps

1. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Open terminal** (where `npm run dev` runs)
3. **Upload a video**
4. **Watch both**:
   - **Browser console**: Look for `[UploadForm]` logs
   - **Terminal**: Look for `[createVideoAction]` logs

**What to look for:**
- ✅ `[createVideoAction] ✅ Video created successfully: {id}`
- ❌ `[createVideoAction] Error: ...`

## 🔧 If Creation Still Fails

If you see errors in terminal, they'll tell us what's wrong:

### "Table does not exist"
**Fix**: Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor

### "RLS blocked" or "Permission denied"
**Fix**: Service role fallback should handle this (already implemented)

### "Unauthorized" or "No creator found"
**Fix**: Creator profile lookup issue - we already fixed this with fallback

### "Column does not exist"
**Fix**: Missing `views` column - run `005_add_video_views.sql` migration

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] `air_publisher_videos` table exists in Supabase
- [ ] `views` column exists (run migration `005_add_video_views.sql`)
- [ ] Upload form shows no errors in browser console
- [ ] Terminal shows `[createVideoAction] ✅ Video created successfully`
- [ ] Video appears in Supabase Dashboard after upload
- [ ] `/videos` page shows the video after redirect

**Try uploading again and share the terminal logs** - they'll tell us exactly what's failing! 🔍
